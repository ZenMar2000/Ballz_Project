Mandatory:
- Balls bounce off window borders
- Red ball can infect other balls by staying nearby
- While being infected, balls turn yellow. If they escape, return green
- Completely infected balls turn from yellow to r

Bonus:
- Balls collide with each other

Extra:
- Improved collisions, now more realistic
- Red balls have circle around them, showing the infection area
- Yellow balls display a shrinking circle, graphically showing how much time they have before turning red
- Audio on bounces between balls
- Audio on bounces on walls
- Audio on infection
- Space key to clear all balls in the window
- R key to restart
- Click to spawn new ball (left for green, right for red)
- Audio on spawn by mouse clicks
- G key boost speed temporarily for red balls
- F key boost speed temporarily for green balls
- T key to enable Red Chase Mode (reds slowly turn toward greens if in range)
- Implement fuzzy logic for deciding which ball to chase (Target distance, infectionTimer, Similar direction)
- Added dumb jokes about balls in the code
